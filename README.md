1. I used the experiment2.csv file for my analysis.
   The first graph plotted (untransformed) formed an S shaped curve tht had plateaued by t = 1000. A second graph was produced with log transformed data. Log transforming the data can be beneficial because it lessens the impact of extreme values and tends to stabilise variance.
   For my linear model, I split the data where t < 660 (the first t value where carrying capacity is reached) and t> 600 (above which, all values oscillate around K). This linear model gave an estimate for N0 as 8.59 (very different from the 1879 given in the raw data). The estimate for r was 0.023605. The estimate for K was 999979341.

2. N(t) = (KN0e^rt)/(K-N0+N0e^rt)
   where N0 = 8.595035, K = 999979341, r = 0.023605, t = 4980
   N(t)=

3.
